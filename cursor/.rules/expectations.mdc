# Developer Guidelines (MUST READ BEFORE CODING)

To ensure that the application is built exactly as envisioned, the following instructions must be **strictly followed** throughout the development process.

## 1. üö´ Do NOT Make Assumptions

**Rule:**  
Do **not** make any assumption‚Äîregardless of its scale‚Äîwithout first discussing it with the product owner.

**Why:**  
Seemingly small assumptions (naming, layout behavior, data handling) can lead to large-scale misalignment. Before proceeding with any unclear requirement, **pause development and consult** with the product owner.

## 2. ‚öñÔ∏è Always Discuss Trade-offs When Multiple Approaches Exist

**Rule:**  
If there are multiple technical or design paths to solve a problem, **list the options**, provide their pros/cons, and consult the product owner for a decision.

**Why:**  
The product owner wants visibility into important decisions that may affect scalability, performance, maintainability, or user experience. Never decide on your own if there's more than one way to solve a task.

## 3. ‚ùì Ask When Unsure About Architecture or Design

**Rule:**  
When in doubt about frontend architecture, backend logic, schema structure, component hierarchy, or tool integration, **ask immediately**.

**Why:**  
Speculative decisions lead to rework. Avoid unnecessary guesswork‚Äî**ask questions early** and get aligned before implementing.

## 4. üé® Follow Design Language and API Contracts Religiously

**Rule:**  
Follow the provided:

- ‚úÖ Frontend Design Language
- ‚úÖ Backend Schema Design
- ‚úÖ API Route Contracts
  **exactly as described**‚Äîwith zero deviations unless explicitly approved.

**Why:**  
This ensures visual consistency, interoperability between frontend and backend, and predictable behavior.

**Frontend Must Use:**

- The specified **glassmorphism** theme
- The defined **primary and secondary color palette**
- The selected **font families**
- The **layout spacing system** and **UI component patterns**
- **Responsiveness across desktop and mobile**

**Backend Must Follow:**

- The documented **MongoDB schema**
- The defined **API routes and request/response structures**
- The **authentication & authorization flow**
- The **OpenAI integration workflow**

No undocumented additions, deletions, or restructuring should occur.

## ‚úÖ Summary of Non-Negotiables

| Area                        | Instruction                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assumptions                 | Never assume ‚Äì always ask                                 |
| Multiple Solutions          | Present all options with trade-offs before implementation |
| Unclear Design/Architecture | Stop and clarify before proceeding                        |
| Frontend Design             | Follow strictly ‚Äì colors, fonts, layout, responsiveness   |
| Backend Schema & APIs       | Follow the provided schema and routes exactly             |

**Failure to follow these will result in technical debt and mandatory rework.**
